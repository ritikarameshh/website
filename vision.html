                            <h4>WHERE IT ALL STARTED</h4>
                            <p>I created Vision as a final project for a Human Factor's class at Arizona State University. Inspired by our class readings, 'Don't Make Me Think' by Steve Krug and 'Hooked' by Nir Eyal, I decided to use techniques and design principles from these books to create a home design AR mobile app. This idea stemmed from how each year in college, as I moved from dorms to apartments, I strived to create a space that was both productive and a haven for relaxation. However, all that redecorating effort often ended up with me just going for a simple setup. I always wished it could feel more like a cozy home away from home.</p>

                            <p>I wished for a tool to easily envision room designs, saving time and money, so I could focus on the important aspects of college life instead of constantly redoing my space. </p>
            
                        </div>

                            <h4>CREATE YOUR VISION</h4>
                            <p>The goal of this project is to offer a space where users can unleash their inner interior designer. It's also a supportive tool for interior designers and architects battling creative blocks. During my college days, I envisioned an interior design platform for sharing designs and drawing inspiration from fellow creators, all within a community-focused environment, distinct from typical social media platforms.</p>

                <p>When I shared Vision with my classmates, their feedback really highlighted its potential. They loved the idea of a friendly, handy app like Vision for sparking ideas for their own spaces. One suggestion that stood out was the cool idea of taking a picture of a piece of furniture and then finding similar but more affordable or differently colored options. It was great to see how Vision could become even more user-friendly and helpful. So, here are some key insights from the feedback I received:

                <ol>
                
                    <li>Add a feature where users can take photos of their furniture sighting and explore similar options within the app.</li>

                    <li>Link furnitures to store website where individuals can purchase their furniture in real time.</li>

                    <li>When I chatted with designers about Vision, it hit me that not everyone begins their interior design adventure with a blank canvas. That's why I'd like to add a feaure that lets you pull colors from your existing room setup. With this tool, you can enhance the current decor using the color coordinator. Just by using the camera to capture the room's aesthetic, and user's will be able to find furniture and decor that match those colors.</li>
                                           
                </ol>
