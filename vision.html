                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>Vision is an augmented-reality phone application. This app will cater to people that struggle to turn their imaginations into reality. This includes new home buyers or people renovating their home, and as the product advances, I hope that professional architects and interior designers would use this as well. Vision will help people decorate their home by giving them the ability to have their idea right in front of them. The goal of this app is for users to have a platform to have create their work and use it for reference </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>According to Nir Eyal, author of Hooked,  users need incentives to use a product. This means creating a product with the hooked cycle: trigger, action, variable reward, and investment. </li>
                        <li>Trigger: Something that prompts consumers to take an action to use the product. (EXTERNAL TRIGGER)</li>
                        <li>Action: To promise a reward to consumers</li>
                        <li>Variable Reward: After taking the action, the user gains something useful. Rewards need to be a variable in order to hook a consumer into a cycle and form a habit. Otherwise the consumer starts anticipating the reward and will start to lose interest and wont come back to the product. </li>
                        <li>Variable Reward: After taking the action, the user gains something useful. Rewards need to be a variable in order to hook a consumer into a cycle and form a habit. Otherwise the consumer starts anticipating the reward and will start to lose interest and wont come back to the product. </li>
                        <li>Investment: Users need to have a personal contribution. Its been shown that we value our own work more than its actually worth. This means a consumer’s investment in a product increases its value disproportionately. This is called the IKEA effect</li>

                    <h3>Function</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Camera: It will have a camera that takes the dimensions of the room layout to get precise measurements so that furnitures, decorations, and etc., can fit well. </li>
                        <li>Profile: The profile is only something the individual who is using that account can see. This app will not be a social media platform, but it will allow users to see other designer’s creations to inspire their own inventions. </li>
                        <li>Your Designs Tab: This where all the users designs will be stored. </li>
                        <li>Color Coordinator Tab: Where users will be able to create folders to create their particular room’s color schemes. In this way they can make sure the shades or contrasts of the colors match. </li>
                        <li>Share Your Work & Get Inspired tabs : These two tabs are where users will be able to share their work to other creators and also view the other’s work to get inspiration. </li>
